This is a project from TOP in which I'll recreate the google homepage in a basic version, using HTML and CSS.
When I finish it I'll have demonstrated that I know:
1. Two ways to move a div around on the page.
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page.
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage.
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage.
5. Center an element horizontally.
6. Identify three ways I can include my CSS styles in a page.
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page.
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere).
